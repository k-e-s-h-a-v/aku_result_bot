# aku_result_bot
* I created a simple python program to check the results of my friends. 
* python modules used: 
  1. urllib 
  1. xlwt
* this program checks the result one by one and saves in 'result.xls'
* I tried module xlsxwriter but had some compatiblity issues in python 3.9 or maybe I am too lazy
* may try to fix it in future.... or not :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
* feel free to suggest changes wherever you find me
